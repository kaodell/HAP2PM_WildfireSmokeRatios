# This git repository contains the codes used to create a TOGA merge, estimate chemical 
# smoke age, anthropogenic influence, and PM to VOC ratios in the WE-CAN campaign.

# The paper resulting from this analysis is currently in prep for ES&T. 

# Details and data from the WE-CAN campaign are publicly available at the following link:
# https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/we-can

# These python scripts require data from the following instruments onboard the C130 during
# WE-CAN: PTR-MS (special data files of specific VOCs from Wade Permer), TOGA, AMS, PCASP,
# UHSAS, SP2, PICARRO, and QCL. 


# Version Details

# 12.19.19 - initial comit with code used to create data files of PM2VOC relationships
#	in young smoke for Kat Navarro. 

# other code described above will be added at a later date
