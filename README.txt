# This git repository contains the codes used to create a TOGA merge, estimate chemical 
# smoke age, anthropogenic influence, and HAP to VOC ratios in the WE-CAN campaign.

# The paper resulting from this analysis is currently in prep for ES&T. 

# Details and data from the WE-CAN campaign are publicly available at the following link:
# https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/we-can

# These python scripts require data from the following instruments onboard the C130 during
# WE-CAN: PTR-MS (special data files of specific VOCs from Wade Permer), TOGA R2 merge, and 
# updated TOGA formaldehyde values.

# Details on each code:
